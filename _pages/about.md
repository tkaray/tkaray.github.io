This is Ray's _after-hours-technical_ site.
For daily messages && blogs, I have another blog named <a href="https://rayray.moe" target="_blank">落雨星影</a>.

Everything which is not suitable for daily blogs will be deposited on this site, and useful resources shared or originally-developed will be duplicated deposited.

你好，这里是 Ray。虽然是无机化学专业，但是还是很喜欢折腾有意思的东西。
如果有什么能够帮助的，这里有最快的方式。

<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/feng-rui-82-22" target="_blank">My Zhihu Account 目前只在用知乎 </a>

The planned discussions include:
- Chemical Softwares
- Front-End Learning
- Interface, Experience Design
- Project Design, Develop and Deploy
- Everything maybe useful/interesting for you & me


Wish you have a good day!

Build with ❤ and 🕊 from 21,03,2020.
